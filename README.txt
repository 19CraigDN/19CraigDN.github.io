1. I created three HTML files: index.html which is my homepage and links to the 
   two other HTML pages, bio.html which contains a short biography of myself, 
   and resume.html which contains my resume including five different sections.
   The three HTML files all use the same CSS file for their styling which
   contains at least 5 rules. All HTML and CSS files pass their respective
   validations.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

3. It took me about 2.5 hours to complete this assignment.
